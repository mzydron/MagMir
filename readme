MagicElon

Simple MagicMirror software written in (for now) in python.

As part of my learning process I'm using RaspberryPi and python to make fully functional MagicMirror. This file will be updated as my project will grow.

As for project made after work, development Can be slow and not always very pretty - yet I'm trying to do my best;

Current funcionalities:

    Fullscreen clock
    Current temperature based on your location (Needs proper configuration)

For config you need API key put into apiKey.py file

Development process and plans for future integration :

Important work to be done:

    reconfiguration of geometry for easier implementation of new visual widgets
    little diod to check if weather data/ news feed is recent.

F. Add speech recognition (possibly gtts module) to allow voice manipulation F. Twitter client for news scrapping
