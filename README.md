# MagMir
Simple MagicMirror software written in (for now) in python.

As part of my learning process I'm using RaspberryPi and python to make fully functional MagicMirror. 
This file will be updated as my project will grow.

As for project made after work, development Can be slow and not always very pretty - yet I'm trying to do my best; 


Current funcionalities: 
- Fullscreen Gui
- Current time
- Current temperature and some icons for visualisation
- Temperature forecast for next 3 and 6 h


For config you need API key put into apiKey.py file and set your location by using this instruction :
https://openweathermap.org/current#one



Development process and plans for future integration : 

Important work to be done: 
- reconfiguration of geometry for easier implementation of new visual widgets / Partialy done
- little diod to check if weather data/ news feed is recent. 
- Integration of GPUPriceChecker (Program for checking GPU prices) which is project for learning .Net and Databases.

F. Add speech recognition (possibly gtts module) to allow voice manipulation
F. Twitter client for news scrapping
